<div class="issuetop"> <h1> Issues with IoT Devices</h1> </div>
<div class issueCaption>
 <p> 
  There is a vast amount of issues when regarding technology. Technology has caused
   issue to physical health by straining eyesight and reduced movement or mental health
    issues through the use of online bullying which causes emotional concern to self and others.
    For IoT devices, these are more or less the same. Though these issues may impact our use of 
    these devices, the problems lie further deeper inside of its technology. Two concerning issues
     of discussion are difficulty in technicality and vulnerabilities. </p>

    <h1>Difficulties in Technicality  </h1>
    An Internet of Things (IoT) device is a physical device that collects and exchanges data with other devices
    through the use
    of the internet.
    <!-- <img id="imgsens" src="images/sensor.jpg" alt="sensor"> -->
    These devices come in various sizes and equipment with different purposes. Through the advance of
    technology, IoT devices have added towards a significant step in digital intellignce as it can update real-time
    data with no human interaction needed to give the device a command or an action.

  <div class="issueTwo">
    <h1> Vulnerabilities</h1>
    <p> The history of IoT devices does not begin with automated technology or smart equipment. It instead started with
      a humble beginning with less power and capabliltiy.
      <ul class="1800">
        <li> Software Vulnerabilities
          <ul> <li> Creating the first machine-operated equipment with the invention of the first 
            telegraph. With just a few operations, it was posible to share information at 
            unfathomable speeds.
            <li>Misconfiguration</li>
 </li> </ul> </ul>
<ul class="1900">
  <li> Network Vulnerabilities
    <ul> <li>Encryption</li>
      <li> Malware</li>
         </ul> </ul>
            <!-- <img id="gHome" src="images/smartSpeaker.jpg" alt="googleHome"> -->
            <ul class="2000"> 
              <li> Social Engineering
   <ul><li> Deception</li>
 <li>Unawareness</li>

  </ul>

 <p> IoT devices has gradually became a norm in our society and with  
 further advnacements waiting to be unvieled towards our future.
