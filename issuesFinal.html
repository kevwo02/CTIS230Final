<div class="issuetop"> <h1> Issues with IoT Devices</h1> </div>
<div class="issueCaption">
 <p> 
  There is a vast amount of issues when regarding technology. Technology has caused
   issue to physical health by straining eyesight and reduced movement or mental health
    issues through the use of online bullying which causes emotional concern to self and others.
    For IoT devices, these are more or less the same. Though these issues may impact our use of 
    these devices, the problems lie further deeper inside of its technology. Two concerning issues
     of discussion are difficulty in technicality and vulnerabilities. </p>

    <h1>Difficulties in Technicality  </h1>
    Technicality is the trivial detail of an object. For IoT devices there is numerous 
    technicalities that all serve various purposes. But often the most smallest detail
     can cause the greatest problem. To shorten time on the development of these devices, 
     manufacturing companies often decide to use some or none of their technicalities which raises a

     larm in the technology industry. Minor changes often lead to economic loss or causing elongated issues.
      These drastic impacts usually victimizes the consumer, which leads to the next top of vulnerabilities.

  <div class="issueTwo">
    <h1> Vulnerabilities</h1>
    <p> Vulnerability is the state of exposure that can possibly lead to an attack. 
      Technology has caused vulnerability in society. Certain software and applications have 
      caused confidential information to be exposed and sold on the internet which victimizes
      an individual in various level of security risks. Bad actors are constantly adapating  like IoT 
      devices to scheme malicious intent to victimize people on the other side of screen or microphone.
       With the use of social media, people are exposing their every life activities which places a target 
       on the victim as well as providing a pseudonymous platform for anyone to write hateful comments.
        There is endless amount of vulnerabilities that places could possibly humanity in chaos.
