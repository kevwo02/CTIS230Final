    <h1>What is an IoT device?</h1>
    An Internet of Things (IoT) device is a physical device that collects and exchanges data with other devices
    through the use
    of the internet.

    These devices come in various sizes and equipment with different purposes. Through the advance of
    technology, IoT devices have added towards a significant step in digital intellignce as it can update real-time
    data with no human interaction needed to give the device a command or an action.

  <div class="history">
    <h1> The history of IoT devices </h1>
    <p> The history of IoT devices does not begin with automated technology or smart equipment. It instead started with
      a humble beginning with less power and capabliltiy.
      <ul class="1800">
        <li> Mid 1800s
          <ul> <li> Creating the first machine-operated equipment with theinvention of the first telegraph. With just a few operations, it was posible to share information at unfathomable speeds.
 </li> </ul> </ul>
<ul class="1900">
  <li> Mid to late 1900s
    <ul> <li>1965: The first ever successive communication between two computers</li>
      <li> 1968: Before IoT had its name, it was known as Machine-2-Machine
        (M2M) communication.</li>
        <li> 1990: The first IoT device was created
          Invented by John Romkey, the device was a smart toaster that could be
          controlled from the internet.</li>
          <li>1999: Kevin Ashton came up with the term "Internet of Things" to describe objects in the real
            world that could connect to the internet
            </li> </ul> </ul>
            <img id="gHome" src="images/smartSpeaker.jpg" alt="googleHome">
            <ul class="2000"> 
              <li> 2000s
   <ul><li> 2000: Plans to create smart appliances were on the rise </li>
2008: The Internet Protocol for Smart Appliances (IPSO)
 was formed to advocate for grand scale usage of smart devices 
  in all fields.</li>
 <li>2013: The rise of sensors brings new addtions to IoT
 devices including thermostats, lighting, camera, speakers, and other major 
 househould appliaces </li>
 <li>2014: The rise of smart cities become a reality with cities like
  Dublin and Seoul investing in IoT devices to expand their growth.</li>
  </ul>

 <p> IoT devices has gradually became a norm in our society and with  
 further advnacements waiting to be unvieled towards our future.
