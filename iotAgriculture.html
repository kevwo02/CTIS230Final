            <h2>Plant Sensors</h2>
            <P>
                There are several variations of plant sensors for different purposes. 
                Some are used for measuring water levels, or tracking fertilization, and can even be used to 
                monitor pest infestations. These IoT devices may seem miniature but they are considered vital to humanity.

            <p>
                One of the neccesities to human survival is food. Yet there is a lack of resources that provides 
                such necessity. Smart tractors are autonomous tractors capable of relieving issues that has caused
                 a downfall to agriculture. These tractors include sensors, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity,
                  real-time analytical management, and more.

            <h2> Smart Weather Stations</h2>

            <p>
                An important factor to agriculture is weather. Smart weather stations uses sensors to report the data that 
                is being tracked and recorded to a database. This vital information allow farm workers to monitor 
                weather patterns and reactionary time to maintain healthy agriculture and livestock.
