            <P>
                In 2013, Amazon bought a Polish company named Ivona Software. Using the wake word "Alexa", it allows this IoT
                device to perform over 90,000 fuctions with little to none physical interaction needed by the user. 
                The echo is often referred as a hub because of its capbility
               to connect to other IoT devices and exchange data.  <img id="echoID" src="images/alexa.jpg" alt="Alexa">

            <p>
                Refrigerators are no longer just for storing groceries anymore. Smart fridges were first invented in the early 2000s, 
                but they have quickly progressed in advancements. With numerous built-in components, 
                these IoT devices are capable to stream videos, monitor information, and even see what is 
                being stored through the touch of a button. <img id="frio" src="images/fridge.jpg" alt="frioImage">
