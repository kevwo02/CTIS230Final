                The future of IoT devices is inevitable as technology continues to adapt and reach new heights. 
                From what we have learned in the past, we as people have evolved and so has our creations and 
                innovations. The internet and other technology started as low-memory pieces of equipment that only used for communication 
                with other human beings. How it sits today, some of our IoT devices are now smaller than our very 
                own hands. But it comes at a cost with IoT devices being a double-edged sword. Behind its greatness 
                lies vast amount of issues that cause catastrophic harm with just the click of a button. Here is a short list
                of advantages and disadvantages regarding the future of IoT devices.

              <p>
                Optimism is considered a valuable asset when discussing technology. 
                Humans want life to become further accessible through the use of technology, 
                and IoT is just one example. With a click of a button or the sound of someone's 
                voice tasks have become easier which frees up our hands. On the other side of this discussion, 
                is alertness. If society does not remain vigilant on the topic of technology, turmoil may occur. 
                It could possibly end businesses where human workers are now being replaced by IoT devices or
                 having confidential information become exposed which places the victims in danger on the internet
                  and in the physical world. What may cause even further disorganization between society and 
                  technology is people losing a piece of their humanity to try and fit into a future technological 
                  utopian society.
